For this assignment, I decided to utilize Spark's API using the Pyspark library. 

Below is the written instructions for running both the q1 and q2 scripts. This assumes you have successfully created a pyspark environment (I recommend using Jupyter Notebook), and have the training_set_tweets already in the current working directory. Here are instructions for configuring the environment if needed: https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-use-pyspark-on-your-computer-9c7180075617 

First, open a terminal and start a pyspark session. 

`pyspark`

your terminal should look like this:

In a second terminal, navigate to the working directory that contain the desired scripts, either q1.py or q2.py
All you have to do is run: 

`python3 q1.py`

or `python3 q2.py`
